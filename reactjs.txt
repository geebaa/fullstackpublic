Though react is a fontend technology , it will be served from the backend.
We therefore use nodejs as a platform to develop react apps. Which then gets
served using a lightweight webserver.

To generate the scaffolding of a react app , a node module called "create-react-app" is used
Install create-react-app globally on the development environment using the below command.
"npm install -g create-react-app "

Now to create the first react app , use the below command.

"create-react-app <app-name>" for example "create-react-app hello-world"
This creates a new directory hello-world and then creates the scaffolding for the react app.

It takes a while using npm to get the scaffolding generated.
Post that , change directory to "hello-world"
run "npm start"
This starts the lightweight web development server wds on http port 3000 and serves the first app.
and also open the default browser to the location "http:\\localhost:3000"
