Start your first angular application with the installation of 

    npm install -g @angular/cli
To create the first project use the below command
    ng new myangularapp
    
This would take a while to generate the scaffolding . 
Once done , change directory to myangularapp and run
    npm start
This would start a webserver on default port 4200.

You can use any browser and interact with the app at "http://localhost:4200"
