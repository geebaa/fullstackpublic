One of the very important part of fullstack development is Node.js. 
This is an environment to run javascript outside of browser. 
Typically suited for backend development using javascript.
This sports the chrome v8 Javascript engine . These notes mainly pertain to Sullstack development
on a windows development environment.
As a developer Managing various releases of Node.js is a very important activity during development
One way to do it is to download the instaler either LTS or Latest from the www.nojs.org website.
Another easy way is to install a Node Version Manager (a.k.a nvm) to manage the versions and update using the cli.
I personally prefer a cli tool to get this job done. This tool for windows can be installed from https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/

Node Version Manager (nvm)
--------------------------
Post installation here are few handy commands of Node Version Manager (nvm)

                 "nvm --version" 
                 "nvm list"
                 "nvm list available"
                 "nvm install latest"
                 "nvm install 14.16.0" for example the LTS at the time of writing is 14.16.0
                 "nvm uninstall 14.16.0" to uninstall the version 14.16.0
A very important step to make node usable after installation is
                 "nvm use 14.16.0" since this was the version that was installed.
you can also install multiple versions and switch between various versions by using the "npm use <version>" 

NodeJs (node)
